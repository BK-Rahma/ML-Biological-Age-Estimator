# ðŸ§¬ Biological Age Estimation â€“ Machine Learning Project

This project aims to estimate biological age from medical and dermatological data using Machine Learning techniques. It includes full data preprocessing, visualization, regression, and classification tasks to analyze age-related features.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Project Contents

- `data.csv`: The raw dataset used in the project.  
- `biological_age_estimation.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook with the full code.  
- `report.pdf`: A detailed report explaining all steps and results.  

---

## ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing

- Cleaning of missing or inconsistent values.  
- Feature selection and transformation.  
- Creation of a new `age_range` column for classification purposes.

---

## ðŸ“Š Data Visualization

Various plots and charts were generated to explore:  
- Age distributions  
- Correlations between features  
- Differences between age ranges

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models

Applied both regression and classification algorithms, including:  
- Linear Regression  
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)  
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Trees  

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation & Results

- Error margins and model performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, RÂ²) were visualized and compared.  
- Classification accuracy was assessed across age ranges.
